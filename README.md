# Counter Strike Source Bot Radio Voice Pack for TNH

GitHub upload. Open source so feel free to fuck about and make your own stuff as well.

Replaces all sosig voice lines in H3VR with the classic Counter-Strike: Source bot dialogue. Now your sosigs will sound like they're straight outta a 2004 LAN party!

Hear your enemies yell "NEGATIVE!" when they miss, "AFFIRMATIVE!" when they spot you, and the iconic "TAKING FIRE, NEED ASSISTANCE!" as you light them up. It's like fighting a squad of Expert bots, except they actually have aim.

Perfect for anyone who grew up getting destroyed by bots on Dust 2 and wants that nostalgic vibe while blasting through Take and Hold.

This is the first mod I make for H3VR, so I hope you enjoy it, because I didn't enjoy combing through 400+ files that thankfully had descriptive audio file names and were also already in WAV format. If you have any questions or any voice line requests, let me know through Discord: @ame_matoi

Thank you for trying my mod!
